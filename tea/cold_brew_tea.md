notes: 
  I don't actually check it anywhere near as often as I said you should. A good
  shake or stir every few hours is all that is required to keep the process
  going

### Writeup ###

So, I've been trying to experiment with cold coffee and am trying to start with
something simple. This is the basics: start with cold water and ground up
coffee; combine and wait.

Right now my basic method is to measure out around 1kg of ingredients and drop
them in because that is what fits in my mason jar. I originally started with
a really high ratio of 1:4 coffee to water, but I realized that I was
saturating the water. I accidentally added a bunch more water to one batch and
the flavor came out the same.

So the process is simple. Weigh out roughly 1g of coffee for every 8 gram of
water (say, 100g coffee for 800g water). I do a very very coarse grind (coarser
than I would use in a french press) although I'm experimenting with this. Then
combine in a mason jar. I recommend pouring water into the coffee slowly and
stirring as you go so they combine well. Every few hours give the coffee a stir
as it will float to the top. After roughly 24 hours, strain and consume.
